# Singly Linked List CLI

A simple CLI for creating and visualizing singly linked lists written in C.

Simply compile and run the program to see the available CLI options.

This project is a fork and thus heavily inspired by [lowlevellearning/singly-linked-list](https://github.com/lowlevellearning/singly-linked-list).
